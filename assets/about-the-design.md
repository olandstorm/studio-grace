## About the design

We initially started off the design process by looking at different color schemes from various movies by Wes Anderson, mostly as an inspiration. We then started to combine some of our favorite colors into our own palette and came to the conclusion of a preferred warm color scheme, with an added off-white and washed black as a contrast to our primary and secondary.

Following the color palette process we went on to look at other one page design structures. Here we looked at various different websites and narrowed our preferred outcome down to an illustrated cartoon aesthetic layered design. We all agreed on wanting to achieve a multilayered design with components floating on top of each other in order to create a depth in the design.

Studio Grace is a creative and fun studio which we wanted to highlight with an easy design with different playful elements. Our logo embodies the feeling of the illustrative and cartoon aesthetic, with a slight 60s vibe. Further we added multiple graphic components to further embody the design. The graphic components are all hand drawn to achieve the desired look and emphasize the feeling of creativity of the studio.

To further bring that feeling into the different components on the website we chose to have rounded borders and as well as a distinct outline of our elements. We also added a small animation to the hyperlinks to increase the interactive feeling to them.

Throughout the design we have worked on a layered and transparent idea of elements overlapping each other, in order to highlight this, we have added some animations to make objects feel less static on the site. For example, a lamp with a continuous light which can be turned off, a menu frame which tilts on hover as well as the dependency Locomotive in JavaScript, to enable different speeds of elements when scrolling throughout the site.

As a font we chose the font Inter which is pretty rounded and well suited for screens with its round impression as a regular weight. We also particularly enjoyed the way in which the font becomes more graphic and angular as the fontweight increases. To create a further separation between our headers and paragraphs we chose to capitalize and italicize all headers.

In our design layout we have attempted to create a natural flow between all elements, striving to implement images into our clear and distinct design and showcasing our business whilst still maintaining the aesthetic of our initial idea. We believe we have achieved the desired playfulness of our aesthetic, unveiling our brand identity.
